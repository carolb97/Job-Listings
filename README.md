# Job Listings

"Job Listings" is a small project to practice PHP. The goal was to parse a json file with job listings and display them along with a filter. To this purpose, a very simple solution is offered here - the jobs are filtered by means of a search bar. The results may be filtered (with one word at a time) by: the role (Frontend, Fullstack or Backend), the level (Junior, Midweight or Senior), the languages used (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python or Ruby) and the tools used (React, Sass, Ruby, RoR, Vue or Django). Filtering the results with several tags simultaneously may be left for future work. To return to the full list, a home button is included.

## File System
This project is organized in a way that ensures an easy maintenance; this logic can be applied to a greater scope of projects.
<ul>
  <li style="list-style-type:square"> The folder "views" contains all the files responsible for displaying the output;</li>
  <li style="list-style-type:square"></li>
  <li style="list-style-type:square"></li>
</ul>
